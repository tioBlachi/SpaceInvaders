# Space Invaders
Space Invaders game using Python and Pygame library

Just a project I worked on in my spare time.

So far this game is only a battle of attrition between the player's health and waves of enemies. Currently no way to regain health, but may be implemented later. When an enemy is killed, player score increases by 1. If enemy goes beyond the bottom of the screen, score decrease by 1. If score is 0 when enemy goes beyond the bottom of the screen, player health decreases by 10.

Game continues until player health reaches 0

Hope you like it
